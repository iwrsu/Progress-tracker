/**
 * Firestore Security Rules
 * 
 * Simple rules allowing public read/write access.
 * Security is handled at the application level through client-side password verification.
 * 
 * WARNING: These rules allow anyone to read/write data if they bypass the UI.
 * This is suitable for personal projects where convenience > security.
 * 
 * For production use, consider:
 * - Server-side authentication
 * - User-based access controls  
 * - Rate limiting
 * - Input validation
